    <h3>Beer Steak</h3>
    <p>A steak, also sometimes called "beef steak", is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1/2 pound) rib-eye steaks, or steak of choice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon pepper</li>
        <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans or bottles beer of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the steaks in a large, shallow container with a lid. Season each side of the steaks with the salt and lemon pepper. Gently pour the beer over the steaks (making sure the seasoning doesn't wash off). Cover, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill for high heat</li>
        <li>Lightly oil grill grate. Place steaks on grill, and discard beer marinade. Cook for 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
